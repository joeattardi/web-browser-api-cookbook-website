summary: Perform asynchronous validation with a network request.

You can perform asynchronous tasks to validate fields. Your validation function should return a `Promise` and set a custom validity message when the result is ready.

In the form's submit handler, await the `Promise` before checking the form's validity. If the asynchronous validation failed, a custom validity message will be set and the error message will be shown.
