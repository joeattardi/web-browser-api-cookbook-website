summary: Change the contents of an element, depending on its size.
---

You can use a `ResizeObserver` to detect when an element's size changes. You can use this event to change the content that is displayed, based on the element's size.

The element in the demo will display its current width. If you resize your browser window enough that the element's width changes, the width will be updated on screen.
