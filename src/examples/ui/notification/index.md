Use the Notification API to show native pop-up notifications. Notifications require the user to first grant permission, then you can show a notification by creating a `Notification` object with some message text.

Notifications can also include arbitrary data, and you can listen for events such as when the notification is clicked or when it is closed, to create actionable notifications.
