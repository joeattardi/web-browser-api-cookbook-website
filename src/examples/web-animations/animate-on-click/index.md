Animate an element by calling its `animate` method, passing a set of keyframes and options. Keyframes can be specified as an array
of objects containing CSS properties to animate.

Each keyframe can also have an `offset` property to specify its position on the animation timeline. An `offset` of `0.25` is 25%, `0.5` is 50%, etc.
