title: Reversing and Canceling Animations
order: 4
chapter: web-animations
slug: web-animations/reverse-cancel
summary: Stop an animation before it finishes and reverse it.
---

Hover over the button, and it will start getting larger. If you move the mouse away before the animation completes, it will immediately reverse and run in the opposite direction for a seamless visual transition. Similarly, if the button is shrinking and you move the mouse back over it, it will start to grow again.

You can play with this by moving the mouse back and forth quickly onto and off of the button to see the animation keep reversing indefinitely.
