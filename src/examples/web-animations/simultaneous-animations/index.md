order: 7
chapter: web-animations
slug: web-animations/simultaneous-animations
summary: Apply multiple animations to an element at the same time.

This square has two separate animations running. Each animation applies a different transform. Normally the second animation's transform would replace the first, but by using the `composite` property you can combine the two.
